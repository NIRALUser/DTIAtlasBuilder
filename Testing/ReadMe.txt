When done compiling, run the command "ctest" in the build directory.
Several tests will run on after another to ensure that the program is working properly:
1- The window should be displaid without any warning or error message, and with nothing in the dataset box. If it is what you see, close the window.
2- The window should be displaid without any warning or error message, and with 3 images in the dataset box and an output directory. If it is what you see, close the window.
3- The window should be displaid without any warning or error message, and with 3 images in the dataset box and an output directory. If it is what you see, push the "Compute" button, and wait for the process to end. When it is done, close the window and check the quality of the images in (build_directory)/Testing/DTIAtlas/4_Final_Resampling/FinalAtlasDTI.nrrd
